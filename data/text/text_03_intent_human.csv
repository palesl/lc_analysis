A monetary penalty of $10,000 may affect an individual but hardly register with a large corporation with the result that some legislation has very high maximum penalties for corporations, for example, $10 million for a breach of  [Corporations Act 2001]  of the TPA.  Conversely, very large penalties may impact on the behaviour of big business but be meaningless to smaller players.  For example, the ALRC has been told that some members of the small business sector prefer provisions that have large monetary penalties because they know that if they get caught they will receive only ‘a slap on the wrist’ as they cannot afford a $10 million penalty",/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/other/lawreform/ALRC/2002/2.html?context=1;query=ca2001172;mask_path=au/other/lawreform/AdminRC+au/other/lawreform/ACTCLRC+au/other/lawreform/ACTLRAC+au/other/lawreform/ACTLRC+au/other/lawreform/ALRC+au/other/lawreform/ALRCBP+au/other/lawreform/ALRCCP+au/other/lawreform/ALRCCPS+au/other/lawreform/ALRCDP+au/other/lawreform/ALRCDRP+au/other/lawreform/ALRCIntroP+au/other/lawreform/ALRCIP+au/other/lawreform/CLRC+au/other/lawreform/NSWLRC+au/other/lawreform/NSWLRCCP+au/other/lawreform/NSWLRCDP+au/other/lawreform/NSWLRCIP+au/other/lawreform/NSWLRCQP+au/other/lawreform/NTLRC+au/other/lawreform/QLRC+au/other/lawreform/QLRCMP+au/other/lawreform/QLRCWP+au/other/lawreform/TASLRI+au/other/lawreform/TASLRIIP+au/other/lawreform/TASLRIRP+au/other/lawreform/VLRC+au/other/lawreform/VLRCCP+au/other/lawreform/VLRCDP+au/other/lawreform/VLRCIP+au/other/lawreform/VLRCInfoP+au/other/lawreform/VLRCInterimRp+au/other/lawreform/VLRCOP+au/other/lawreform/VLRCPP+au/other/lawreform/VicLRCmr+au/other/lawreform/VicLRCmrWP+au/other/lawreform/VicLRComm+nz/other/lawreform/NZIPACRp+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCR+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCIP+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCMBP+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCMP+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCOP+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCPP+nz/other/lawreform/NZLCSP+nz/other/lawreform/NZAHLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZALLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZCCLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZCLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZELRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZFamJustRef+nz/other/lawreform/NZPenalPP+nz/other/lawreform/NZPPLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZPELRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZPALRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZRMLawRef+nz/other/lawreform/NZSSWLRCom+nz/other/lawreform/NZTGLRCom,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
